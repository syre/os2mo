# We do not use alpine. The resulting image is smaller, but there is currently
# no support for pip installation of wheels (binary) packages. It falls back to
# installing from source which is very time consuming. See

# https://github.com/docker-library/docs/issues/904

# We also don't use -slim as some python packages are not wheels and needs
# compiling with the tools for the non -slim image.
